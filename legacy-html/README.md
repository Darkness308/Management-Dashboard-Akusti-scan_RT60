# Legacy HTML Files

This folder contains standalone HTML files that were used during the development process.

## Purpose

These files are **legacy prototypes** and **early design iterations** that have been replaced by the modern React-based Management Dashboard.

## Status

⚠️ **DEPRECATED** - These files are no longer maintained or used in production.

## Modern Alternative

The current production application is a React-based SPA located in the `/src` directory. Use the following commands:

```bash
# Development
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## Contents

- Various dashboard prototypes (consolidated_dashboard.html, dashboard_final.html, etc.)
- Module prototypes (innovation_dashboard, market_business, etc.)
- Proof-of-concept files (simulation_open_source, ux_strategie, etc.)

## Migration

All functionality from these HTML files has been migrated to the React application with improved:
- ✅ Component modularity
- ✅ State management (Zustand)
- ✅ Agent-based architecture
- ✅ Performance optimization
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Code maintainability

---

**Note:** These files are kept for reference purposes only and may be removed in future versions.
